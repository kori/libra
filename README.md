# libra
Libra is a [mpd](https://musicpd.org)  listen submitter to [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/).

It works similarly to [mpdscribble](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpdscribble).

You can install libra with:

`go get github.com/kori/libra`

It's still in beta, but it works.

### TODO
	[ ] add an interface (with options like help, daemonize)
	[ ] handle logs
	[ ] handle graceful exits
